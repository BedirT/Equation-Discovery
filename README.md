# Equation-Discovery

I will share my experiences during my summer research, with Dr.Ricardo Vilalta on Equation Discovery. 

In current stage we are going over some old papers to get familirize with the subject. [Here are the papers](https://github.com/BedirT/Equation-Discovery/edit/master/papers/) if you are interested. We also following a book for the early stages.

### What is the task of equation discovery?

Equation discovery is the area of machine learning that develops methods for automated discovery of quantitative laws, expressed in the form of equations, in collections of measured data. It is strongly related to the area of system identification. However, mainstream system identification methods work under the assumption that the structure of the model, i.e., the form of the equations, is known and are concerned with determining the values of the constant parameters in the model that minimize the discrepancy between measured and simulated data. Equation discovery systems, on the other hand, aim at identifying both an adequate structure of the equations and appropriate values of the constant parameters. Again, the discrepancy between measured and simulated data is to be minimized.[-1-](http://kt.ijs.si/ljupco_todorovski/ed/)
